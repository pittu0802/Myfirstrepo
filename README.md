# Myfirstrepo

- Scraped the data of GitHub users from Hyderabad with over 50 followers using python.
- During analysis, I found that the majority of developers in Hyderabad primarily use JavaScript as their main programming language for repositories.
-  Recommend that developers in Hyderabad focus on contributing to open-source projects to increase their visibility and networking opportunities within the tech community.
